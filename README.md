# tip-calculator-OBC

This project was created following the free classes from the One BitCode website, wich includes HTML, CSS and JavaScript. 

I took the liberty to also change some of the features of the CSS class so the site could be more eye pleasing. 
This was my first contact with JavaScript and DOM. 

Hope you enjoy!
